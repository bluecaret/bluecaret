      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>This document was last updated on October 16,&nbsp;2022.</p>

      <p>In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.</p>

      <p>This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Jonathan W Hancock (doing business as BlueCaret) ("BlueCaret", "we", "us", or "our") including CaretTab, RMS, Two Steps Forward and any other application/service listed on this website (<a href="https://bluecaret.com">https://bluecaret.com</a>).</p>

      <h3>What we collect and why</h3>

      <p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:</p>

      <h4>Identity & access</h4>

      <p>When you sign up for a BlueCaret product, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name and email address. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We'll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won't use your name in marketing statements without your permission either.</p>

      <h4>Billing information</h4>

      <p>When you pay for a BlueCaret product, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processors, Stripe and ExtensionPay, and doesn't ever go through our servers. All payment data is stored by Stripe. You may find their privacy policy notice link here: <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>. The privacy policy for ExtensionPay can be found at the bottom of their homepage here: <a href="https://extensionpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://extensionpay.com/</a></p>

      <h4>Website interactions</h4>

      <p>When you browse our marketing pages or applications (if applicable), your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address but not your user account if you are signed into our Services. Other web analytics we utilize are described further in the Cookies and Do Not Track section. Currently web analytics are only used on Bluecaret.com.</p>

      <h4>Cookies and Do Not Track</h4>

      <p>We may use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and support some in-house analytics.</p>

      <p>We partner with Google for some marketing activities. If you are coming to BlueCaret from a Google ad, and are in the United States, Google will send a cookie to your browser to determine whether you visited Bluecaret.com because of a particular advertisement you viewed. This enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of these ads.</p>

      <p>A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

      <p>At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.</p>

      <h4>Voluntary correspondence</h4>

      <p>When you write BlueCaret with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.</p>

      <h4>Information we do not collect</h4>

      <p>We don't collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.</p>

      <p>We also do not collect any biometric data.</p>

      <h4>How we approach app permissions</h4>

      <p>Our philosophy is to ask for the bare minimum of permissions from you to give you a great app experience with maximum privacy. By default, we have access to the network to ensure the app can connect to and communicate with the Internet. In most cases, we ask for permission just-in-time so that you can decide if you want to grant access to things like contacts, camera, and calendar.</p>

      <p>It's impossible for our apps to try to use a sensitive OS feature without requesting access explicitly from you, so you'll always know exactly when and what we're requesting. You will never be required to grant any permission (although a given feature may not work or work well without it).</p>

      <h3>When we access or share your information</h3>

      <p>Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we'll ever access or share your info are:</p>

      <p>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.</p>

      <p>When required under applicable law.</p>

      <p>BlueCaret is a US company and all data infrastructure are located in the US.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If US law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we'll always inform you when such requests are made. In the event a government authority outside the US approaches BlueCaret with a request, our default stance is to refuse unless the US government compels us to comply through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. We have never received a National Security Letter or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) order.</li>
        <li>Similarly, if BlueCaret receives a request to preserve data, we refuse unless compelled by either the US Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f) or a properly served US subpoena for civil matters. In both of these situations, we have to comply. In these situations, we notify affected customers as soon as possible unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. We do not share preserved data unless absolutely required under the Stored Communications Act or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we destroy any preserved copies we made of customer data once the preservation period lapses.</li>
        <li>If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or entity, we do not assist.</li>
        <li>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Finally, if BlueCaret is acquired by or merged with another company — we don't plan on that, but if it happens — we'll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

      <h3>Your rights with respect to your information</h3>

      <p>At BlueCaret, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. BlueCaret recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Right to Know. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>
        <li>Right of Access. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>
        <li>Right to Correction. You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li>
        <li>Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using BlueCaret services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>
        <li>Right to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"></a>.</li>
        <li>Right to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li>
        <li>Right to Object. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>
        <li>Right to Portability. You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>
        <li>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making. You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
        <li>Right to Non-Discrimination. This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.</p>

      <p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:bluecaret@outlook.com">bluecaret@outlook.com</a>. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.</p>

      <p>If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, at <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"></a>.</p>

      <h3>How we secure your data</h3>

      <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

      <h3>What happens when you delete data in your product accounts</h3>

      <p>In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash data. Anything you trash on your product accounts while they are active are immediatly deleted and are no longer accessible via the application. We also delete your data after an account is cancelled.</p>

      <h3>Location of site and data</h3>

      <p>Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>

      <h3>Changes & questions</h3>

      <p>We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices.</p>

      <p>Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at bluecaret@outlook.com and we'll be happy to answer them!</p>
