          <details>
            <summary>Is CaretTab free to use?</summary>
            <p>Yes! All features and functionality is completely free to use.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>Are there advertisements in the extension?</summary>
            <p>None at all!</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Does CaretTab track my data? / Can the developer see my data?</summary>
            <p>
              Nope. Nor do I want to! The extension does not require any accounts, does no tracking, has no
              advertisements, and no unnecessary data collection. There isn't even any analytics involved (with the
              exception of this site and the store listings).
            </p>
            <p>
              Your data and settings are saved to your browser's internal storage. No data is saved on any CaretTab
              servers. The only time your data or settings will be placed on a server would be if you are signed into
              your browser and have enabled syncing, in which case it is only synced with your browser maker's servers.
              CaretTab only offers it to be synced but does not have any access to that data outside your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't just talk either, CaretTab's source code is Open Source and freely available on
              <a href="https://github.com/bluecaret/carettab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.

            <summary>What/who is BlueCaret and CaretTab, I'm confused by the names!</summary>
            <p>
              Understandable confusion! "BlueCaret" is the screen name/alias for the owner and developer of this site
              and the CaretTab extension, and is also the name of the business it is all listed under. "CaretTab" is the
              name I gave this Chrome Extension that replaces the New Tab page. CaretTab is listed in the Web Stores
              under the publisher name of BlueCaret. This is also why pages such as the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
              bring you to bluecaret.com.

          <details>
            <summary>What permissions does CaretTab use?</summary>
            <p>
              CaretTab attempts to use minimal permissions when possible. If anything is not needed at the start, you
              will be prompted for the optional permission when enabling the feature that requires it. Below is a list
              of the permissions CaretTab uses and why:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Used to store your settings in the browser's storage area.</li>
              <li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>https://dtfv5mvrx9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/*</strong>: This is an Amazon Web
                    Services server that CaretTab accesses to retrieve various data such us API access for weather among

                  </li>

          <h4>Using the extension</h4>

          <details>
            <summary>How do I save my changes to settings?</summary>
            <p>
              Anytime you close the settings panel your changes are automatically saved. You can also click the save
              button in the top right corner at any time to save without closing. In addition, some actions such as
              adding or removing widgets will automatically save in that moment. You can revert some changes by simply
              refreshing or closing the tab before closing the settings panel; anything that was changed since opening
              the settings should revert back.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How do I sync my settings between browsers?</summary>
            <p>
              Settings sync is automatically enabled when you sign into your browser, providing the browser supports
              syncing. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge should both sync your settings when signed into each
              respectively.
            </p>
            <p>It is currently not possible to sync your settings between different types of browsers.</p>
            <p>
              Another option available is exporting your settings from one browser and importing them to the other. This
              option can be found in the Settings Dashboard, under "Extension settings", select "Advanced settings" and
              you will see an Export and Import option. Note that this is a manual process and any time you make changes
              to your settings you will want to perform the export/import process again.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How do I move a widget to a different spot?</summary>
            <p>
              Once you've added a widget, click the "edit" button on the dashboard then open the "Widget container"
              section. In this area you can change the alignment, position, and size of the widget container. You may
              need to play around with some of the options here to get what you are looking for as some may work
              slightly different depending on the widget type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pro tip: Click the square icon in the top right corner of the settings panel near the save button to
              enable the Outliner mode. This will temporarily display an outline around widgets giving you a better idea
              of what the size and placement of the widget actually is. Also try the dotted grid icon next to it which
              overlays a grid on the page to help with alignment.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Why is the widget not showing on the page?</summary>
            <p>
              There are a few possibilities. First, make sure the widget is not disabled on the Settings Dashboard;
              ensure the toggle is on next to the widget name in the list of widgets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, you might need to try adjusting the options within the "Widget Container" section of the widget's
              settings. The widget being set too small or large, or the position is too far one direction or the other,
              could all contribute to the widget not being visible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, it could be the text color of the widget is the same or similar to the background color. Try
              adjusting the color options under "Widget Font Styles".
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Why is the shadow not showing?</summary>
            <p>Be sure that the shadow is enabled via the "Enable" option at the top right of the shadow menu.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>The widgets don't seem to be matching with the size I set.</summary>
            <p>
              Different widgets may behave differently to the size options available. For example, you could set the
              weather widget to a very small width in the container settings, but it still may display wider as the
              content within will keep with the layout. This can cause the content to "overflow" the widget's container.
            </p>
            <p>
              One way to avoid this when designing your tab is by clicking the square icon at the top right of the
              Settings panel, it's the button to the right of the eye. Enabling this option will show an outline around
              all widget containers, this makes it easy to tell if any content is overflowing. The option will
              automatically be disabled when you open a new tab, or you can click it again to disable.
            </p>
            <p>
              While you are here, try the next button to the right that looks like a dotted grid. This option overlays a
              grid on the tab page, making it easy to align widgets.
            </p>
